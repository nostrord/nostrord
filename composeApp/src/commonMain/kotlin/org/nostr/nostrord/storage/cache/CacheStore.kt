 * Bulk, queryable, bounded cache for chat messages and generic events — the persistence
 * seam for "never wait on the relay for something you've seen". Separate from [SecureStorage]
 * (which stays for small KV slots and credentials): message/event history is large and needs
 * range queries and byte-bounded eviction that a flat KV blob can't provide.
 *
 * Everything is `suspend` because the web backend (IndexedDB) is async and the native backend
 * (SQLite) runs off the main thread. Every row is scoped by [account] (pubkey hex) so logout
 * clears one account without touching another. The shape here is engine-agnostic on purpose:
 * native binds it to SQLDelight, web to IndexedDB, sharing this interface and the logical schema,
 * never the engine.
