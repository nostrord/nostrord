/**
 * User-facing labels and descriptions for the NIP-29 group access flags, shared by the create,
 * edit and manage modals on both platforms so the wording can't drift between them.
 *
 * Descriptions follow NIP-29 (https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md):
 *  - private    -> only members can READ messages
 *  - closed     -> join requests are ignored (invite-only)
 *  - restricted -> only members can WRITE (post) messages
 *  - hidden     -> relays hide the group's metadata from non-members
 *
 * The modals lay these out read / join / write / visibility, matching this order.
