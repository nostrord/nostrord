/**
 * Platform-agnostic decision machine for chat-feed scroll behaviour, shared by the
 * native (Compose LazyColumn) and web (React/DOM) chat views.
 *
 * It holds ONLY the latch state and the transition rules; it performs no actual
 * scrolling. Callers translate the returned decisions into platform calls
 * (`LazyListState.scrollToItem` on native, `el.scrollTop` / `scrollIntoView` on
 * web). Keeping the rules here means the "open at divider vs bottom", "pin to
 * bottom", and "round-trip before re-pinning" policy is defined once and unit
 * tested in `commonTest`, instead of being re-derived per platform.
 *
 * State is immutable; every transition returns a fresh [ChatScrollState]. The
 * native holder wraps it in Compose `mutableStateOf` so the FAB recomposes.
